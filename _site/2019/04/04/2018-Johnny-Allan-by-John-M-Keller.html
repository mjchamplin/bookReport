  <p>The book itself: inarguably short and concise, but comprised of long sentences which hardly meander, rather a long cohesive chain of thoughts punctuated (literally and figuratively) by commas. And it’s a good thing, too, because while reading a paragraph-long sentence, it’s important to stop to breathe.</p>

<p>The core characters, Alan (our narrator) and Johnny Allan (the subject of the novel’s fascination, indeed the center around which both the narrative and the other characters revolve) feel well-rendered and dimensional. I cannot say the same for for Amelia, our narrator’s wife, who dwells in a realm of cliché that only ever /hints/ at self-awareness, and surfaces in three-dimensions solely when it serves our narrator or eponym (and lest we forget /Rachel/, our Manhattan lawyer love interest(?) who resembles a cardboard cutout more than a real person). Indeed, Amelia seems to exist only to teach our heroes a lesson then fade away to warmer climates.</p>

<p>The novel never lacks for beautiful language, apart even from those long and sometimes breathless sentences, and moments where the author evokes emphatically visceral images of New York City. This is perhaps the book’s greatest strength: its imagery and feeling, its strange brevity. In the /notes/ section at the end of the book, the author describes having written it in a month; I find myself divided as to whether I’d have rather known this at the beginning, or if it provided a satisfying realization at the end of the book. Here is a work of literary impressionism; a glimpse into lives, with liberties taken and details omitted because this is not a book about things, this is a book about the /ideas/ of things.</p>
