Wonderful in the way it unfolds slowly, at least until those moments where it unfolds quickly, showing the reader the transient details it turns out were there, hidden in plain sight. An exploration of women across generations, their similarities, their cruelties, their ultimate kindnesses; a powerful meditation on loss and survival. Not a ghost story, yet populated by ghosts, of memory, of the weight of the past and the way it haunts a place.
