I thought this was a very good novel, a small and intimate story. I like the structure, where we learn of (view spoiler) in the very beginning, then skip back in time in such a way that we know the ending will reveal the mechanism. Despite this, I still wasn't prepared.

I enjoyed this novel; I enjoyed the flawed narrator who, despite being aware of her flaws, was nonetheless so often driven by them; I enjoyed the intimacy she shared with Alison, the way in some sense she brought her out of herself, for better or for worse. The father with his dementia, his memories slipping into oblivion, revealing truths Gus had sought her entire life, a symbolic datum around which the ever-present theme of impermanence rotates.
